<h3>Free your Writing.</h3>

<p style="font-size: 29px;line-height: 34px;">Nowadays there're many publishing platforms out there; hosted or non-hosted solutions are popping out like snails after a storm. Simvla is different because it goes straight to the point of enrich the user experience and his writing workflow.</p>
        
<h3>Custom Built Features</h3>
        
<p>There're many key features which differs a tool from a great tool, some of them are there under your noose, someone else are hidden under the hood. We asked many feedback while developing the platform and end up with the idea that a bunch of well done features are better than hundreds of non-sense ones. You'll feel like a child with his first toy.</p>

<h3>Clean & Responsive Design</h3>

<p>Our platform has been built with simplicity in mind, so you'll find nothing disturbing or something that distracts both the writing experience and the reading experience.</p>

<h3>Textile Markup</h3>

<p>We know, we know. In the Markdown era why the f**k are you going to use Textile? Well the answer it's very easy: we find it less complicated. As we cater to a wide audience of experts and non-experts we wanted the most easy and speedy way to write content and Textile provides just that.</p>

<h3>External Sources</h3>

<p>Very often users are inspired by something they read on the web, and many times that is a starting point to build up their opinion on that topic, so we thought that these are important as much as your content so we give you the ability to link to that source very easily. </p>

<h3>Image Uploads</h3>

<p>The're many services out there which act like a simple content delivery network for you images and files. We built one on top of our Editor because, you know, we like simplicity. Just drag & drop an image in the body of your Editor and it will automagically format so that you can go on writing your article.</p>
        
        <h3>Aren't you a copy of Svbtle?</h3>

        <p style="font-size: 29px;line-height: 34px;">Yeah we know it sounds dead similar, but let's think about it one moment. What's the problem with a "similar" publishing tool with a slightly different approach and feel? <strong>Isn't that Svbtle thing something for a closed circle of people?</strong> We think that people must be able to say whatever they want to say, that everyone deserves a cleaner experience.</p>
